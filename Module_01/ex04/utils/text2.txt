Sweet Caroline

Where it began
I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believe you'd come along?
Hands
Touchin' hands
Reachin' out
Touching me, touchin' you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you?
Warm
Touchin' warm
Reachin' out
Touchin' me, touchin' you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would, oh, no, no
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
